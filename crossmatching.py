                - sky: The sky matcher compares positions on the celestial 
                       sphere with a fixed error radius. Rows are considered 
                       to match when the two (ra, dec) positions are within 
                       max-error arcseconds of each other along a great circle.

    values     string, Defines the values from table 1 which are used to 
                determine whether a match has occurred. These will typically 
                be coordinate values such as RA and Dec and perhaps some 
                per-row error values as well, though exactly what values are 
                required is determined by the kind of match as determined by 
                matcher.

    action      string, Determines the form of the table which will be output as a result of the internal match. The options are:

                    identify: The output table is the same as the input table except that it contains two additional columns, GroupID and GroupSize, following the input columns. Each group of rows which matched is assigned a unique integer, recorded in the GroupID column, and the size of each group is recorded in the GroupSize column. Rows which don't match any others (singles) have null values in both these columns.
                    keep0: The result is a new table containing only "single" rows, that is ones which don't match any other rows in the table. Any other rows are thrown out.
                    keep1: The result is a new table in which only one row (the first in the input table order) from each group of matching ones is retained. A subsequent intra-table match with the same criteria would therefore show no matches.
                    wideN: The result is a new "wide" table consisting of matched rows in the input table stacked next to each other. Only groups of exactly N rows in the input table are used to form the output table; each row of the output table consists of the columns of the first group member, followed by the columns of the second group member and so on. The output table therefore has N times as many columns as the input table. The column names in the new table have _1, _2, ... appended to them to avoid duplication.

    join        string, Determines which rows are included in the output table. 
                The matching algorithm determines which of the rows from the 
                first table correspond to which rows from the second. 
                This parameter determines what to do with that information. 
                Perhaps the most obvious thing is to write out a table 
                containing only rows which correspond to a row in both of the 
                two input tables. However, you may also want to see the 
                unmatched rows from one or both input tables, or rows present 
                in one table but unmatched in the other, or other possibilities.

                    1and2: An output row for each row represented in both input 
                            tables (INNER JOIN)
                    
                    1or2: An output row for each row represented in either or 
                            both of the input tables (FULL OUTER JOIN)

                            table 1 (LEFT OUTER JOIN)
                    
                    all2: An output row for each matched or unmatched row in 
                            table 2 (RIGHT OUTER JOIN)

                            first table but are not matched in the second table
